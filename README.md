What is CodyCoin?
----------------

CodyCoin is an experimental digital currency forked from Bitcoin that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. CodyCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate

out collectively by the network. CodyCoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.
